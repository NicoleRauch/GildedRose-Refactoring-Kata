- This is not about discovering your weaknesses or about your deficits. I want to learn about the way you think, how you address problems 

- As un-stressful as possible. If anything is unclear or if you have any question whatsoever, please feel free to ask.

- This is not about you finishing the task, but about seeing how you approach a problem and how you work in a pair.

- Please think loudly, so I can see what's going on in your head, and I can support you if needed
